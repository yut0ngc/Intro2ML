        "In the next lab exercise, we will delve a bit deeper at implementation level, and try to extend your model to handle more than one input variable. We will also start making your code a bit more efficient with vectorised implementations so that you can perform computations on multiple training instances simultaneously. This will hopefully help you get started on implementing Neural Networks (which we will unfortunately not cover in these lab exercises as it is part of your second coursework).  \n",
